## API Boundaries

This application utilizes the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which has some known limitations:

* **Inconsistent Data:** The API may occasionally return weather information for cities that do not exist or are misspelled. For example, searching for "Londn" might incorrectly return data for "London". This can lead to misleading results.
* **Error Handling:** While the application includes robust error messages (e.g., "Oops! City Not Found") to mitigate this, users are strongly advised to verify the accuracy of city names before submitting requests.
* **Rate Limits:** The free tier of the OpenWeatherMap API has rate limits. Frequent requests may trigger throttling, potentially causing temporary delays or errors in receiving weather data.


Future improvements may involve implementing custom validation or integrating with a more reliable API source.
